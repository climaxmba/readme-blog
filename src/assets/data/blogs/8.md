## Introduction

Spring Boot is a popular Java framework that simplifies the development of Spring-based applications. It provides a quick and easy way to create RESTful APIs, making it a go-to choice for many developers. This guide will walk you through the steps of creating a simple REST API using Spring Boot.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Spring Boot CLI or a build tool like Maven or Gradle

## Creating a Spring Boot Project

1. **Using Spring Initializr:**

   - Go to [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/).
   - Select "Maven Project" or "Gradle Project".
   - Choose your preferred language (Java or Kotlin).
   - Add the "Spring Web" dependency.
   - Click "Generate Project" and download the ZIP file.

2. **Using Spring Boot CLI:**
   ```bash
   spring init --type=maven-project --dependencies=spring-boot-starter-web --name=my-rest-api
   ```

## Creating a REST Controller

A REST controller is a Spring component that handles incoming HTTP requests and returns appropriate responses. Here's a basic example:

```java
@RestController
public class HelloWorldController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

In this example, the `@RestController` annotation indicates that this class is a REST controller. The `@GetMapping("/hello")` annotation specifies that the `hello()` method will handle GET requests to the `/hello` endpoint.

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following commands:

- **Maven:**
  ```bash
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
- **Gradle:**
  ```bash
  gradle bootRun
  ```

## Testing the API

You can test your API using a tool like Postman or curl. To test the `hello` endpoint, you can send a GET request to [http://localhost:8080/hello](http://localhost:8080/hello). You should receive a response with the text "Hello, World!".

## Adding More Endpoints

You can create more endpoints to handle different HTTP methods and return various data formats. For example, to create a POST endpoint that accepts a JSON object:

```java
@PostMapping("/users")
public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
    // Save the user to a database or other data store
    return user;
}
```

## Conclusion

Spring Boot provides a powerful and convenient way to create REST APIs in Java. By following these steps and leveraging the features of Spring Boot, you can quickly build robust and scalable APIs for your applications.
